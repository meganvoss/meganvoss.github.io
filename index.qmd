About me:

As a motivated student at Colorado State University majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with an interest in the field of education, I have a passion for environmental science as well as for working with adolescents and children. Hands-on jobs with required teamwork and activity are where I succeed. Creating safe and fun spaces for others, especially kids, is a main strength I have, and I am excited to pursue further opportunities with these traits.
